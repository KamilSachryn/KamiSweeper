# Minesweeper

A GUI project based on Microsoft's Minesweeper, where the player tries to guess where mines are hidden based on surrounding clues. 

### Installation

Compilation requires 

 - `Visual Studio`
 - `C#.net`

### Usage

A game is automatically started once the player picks the first square, at which point the rest of the board is generated in order to make sure the first click is always safe. 

Left clicking reveals a square
Right clicking flags a square

Whenever an adjacent square has a bomb the tile will displays the amount of bombs adjacent to that square.

The goal of the game is to reveal all non-bomb squares.
